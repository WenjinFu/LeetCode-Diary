## Dynamic Programming

## LeetCode Problem Solution

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,

```mathematica
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

 

**Example 1:**

```mathematica
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```mathematica
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```mathematica
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

### Concept/Characteristic of Dynamic Programming:

1. Problem can be broken into smaller verions of original problem that are re-used multiple time.
2. Solution can be formed from optimal solutions to overlapping subproblems

2 ways to implement DP: 1. Bottom up-tabulation 2. Top-down-Memoization (Recursion)

### CODE:

TOP-DOWN



```python
class Solution(object):
    def fib(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return self.fib(n-1) + self.fib(n-2)
```

Time complexity: O(2^N) & Space complexity: O(N) - max size of stack
